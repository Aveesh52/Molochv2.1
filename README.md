# Molochv2.1
Moloch DAO v2 with multi-summoner capabilities, plus register function for metadata. Summoner uses EIP-1167 proxy pattern to decrease gas costs significantly w/r to moloch v2 summoning. 

To get started playing with this, we recommend popping Flat_Moloch_v2.1.sol into Remix. 

Developed on top of Moloch v2 by Ross Campbell, Zephram Lou, and Bill Warren in the pursuit of Moloch mysticism.
